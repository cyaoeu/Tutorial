# Do everything in the tutorial first, then copy old files to new TG folder (except for model folders and stuff not related to TecoGAN)

1. Get updated callsubprocess.py
2. `pyinstaller -F callsubprocess.py`
3. Rename file tgmain.exe, put in TGMAIN-CUDA folder
4. Get runGan104.py and main104.py, put in TG folder
5. In the top of runGan104.py replace the path with your own TG path
6. In TGMAIN-CUDA create a file called GAN.txt and write `104` and save (no spaces, no enter)
7. Now it works! ... maybe...
